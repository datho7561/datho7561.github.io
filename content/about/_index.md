I am a software developer, currently working at Red Hat.
I did my undergrad at McMaster University.
Currently, I am working on the Eclipse IDE, specifically Eclipse JDT.
In the past, I've worked on various VS Code extensions,
most notably vscode-xml, vscode-quarkus, and vscode-openshift.

Outside of work, I enjoy canoe camping, rock climbing,
music (piano, trumpet, listening to and producing EDM),
VR (Beat Saber and some VR Chat),
and visual novels (mostly murder mystery ones).
