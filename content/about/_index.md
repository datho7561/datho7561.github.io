I am a software developer, currently working at IBM.
I've also worked at Red Hat in the past.
I did my undergrad at McMaster University.
Currently, I am working on the Eclipse IDE,
specifically [Eclipse JDT](https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/eclipse.jdt.core).
In the past, I've worked on various VS Code extensions,
most notably
[vscode-xml](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml),
[vscode-quarkus](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-quarkus),
and [vscode-openshift](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools).

Outside of work, I enjoy canoe camping, rock climbing,
music (piano, trumpet, listening to and producing EDM),
virtual reality (Beat Saber and some VR Chat),
visual novels (mostly murder mystery ones),
and tabletop roleplaying games.
